# Welcome to *The GraphQuantum Project*! 🐈 🌸 🪄

*The GraphQuantum Project* is a collection of packages of algorithms we have produced over the course of our research into quantum spin networks and their corresponding graph spectra, primarily written in Julia. We also, in the `examples/` and `data/` folders of our repositories, include key numerical results and data obtained on various graph representations of quantum networks. So far, we are working on packaging:

- The first non-na&iuml;ve deterministic algorithm to compute graph *S*-bandwidth, an indicator of transfer fidelity between qubits
- A novel optimization approach using the Shubert-Piyavskii method to investigate perfect state transfer on quantum networks
- A method for tracking and visualizing state transfer on a quantum network over a finite interval, with reasonable granularity
